# Intro Into CSS

CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a language used to describe reusable styles for presenting documents written in a markup language.
 Its concept was originated by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994.
  In December 1996, CSS was made a specification by the W3C and today allows web developers to alter the layout and appearance of their web pages.
   For example, CSS may be used to change the font used in certain HTML element, as well as its size and color.
    A single CSS file may be linked to multiple pages, which allows a developer to change the appearance of all the pages at the same time.


`Selector` : Define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.
`property` : Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to change.
`value` : Indicates how you want to change stylistic features.
