# Overview

Our projects will be hosted in Github. Each developer will be using different git branches for feature work. That work will be pushed into a main branch. It's going to be important that you know how to traverse git branches and work with git history.

## Activity

- Create a feature branch of your class's curriculum
- Add your name to the class's team roster and push to your remote branch
- Make a pull request (PR) to the main branch
- Get someone to review/approve your PR
- Merge your feature branch to the main branch
