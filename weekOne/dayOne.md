# Day 1 Notes

Today we started with a challenge in which you had five minutes to complete [User Inyerface](https://userinyerface.com/). I implore you to try to finish that so you understand the frustration of being a user with a crappy interface.

We also spoke about the history of the [internet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work) and I asked you to favorite the [Front End Masters Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/) as well as the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). I should have added CSS-tricks to that list as well.


I shared the metrics I have for you. I don't expect you to complete them all every way but I do expect you to try.

1. One Git Commit A Day
2. One Code Challenge A Day
3. A Codepen A Week
4. A Dev.to Post A Week
5. Build a thing
